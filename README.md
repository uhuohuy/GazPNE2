GazPNE2.0: A general and annotation-free place name extractor for microblogs fusing gazetteer and transformer model

In this paper, we present a robust and general place name extractor for English tweets, GazPNE2,  which fuses deep learning, global gazetteers (e.g., OpenStreetMap), and pretrained transformer models, requiring no manually annotated data. GazPNE2 can extract place names at both coarse (e.g., country and city) and fine-grained (e.g., street and creek) levels and place names with abbreviations (e.g., `tx' for `Texas' and `studemont rd' for `studemont road'). 
	We compare GazPNE2 with 9 competing approaches on 11 public tweet data sets, containing 21,393 tweets and 16,790 place names across the world. The results show our proposed approach achieves SotA performance on the test data with an average F1 of 0.8.
 
 We will publish the code soon.
